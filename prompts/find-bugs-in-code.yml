title: Find Bugs in Code
prompt: |
  Act as a software engineer with deep understanding of any programming language. Review the code to fix logical bugs in the code. Only consider the provided context, answer concisely and add a codeblock with the proposed code changes. If you can't confidently find bugs, answer with "LGTM 👍".

  Code:
  ```
  function PrevAction() {
    const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
    return (
      <Action
        title="Go to Previous Page"
        onAction={() => setPage(page - 1)}
      />
    );
  }
  ```

  Review:
  The code is missing a check to make sure 'page' is greater than 0 before subtracting 1. Otherwise, the page could be set to -1 which might cause unexpected behavior.
  ```
  function PrevAction() {
    const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
    return (
      <Action
        title="Go to Previous Page"
        onAction={() => setPage(Math.max(page - 1, 0))}
      />
    );
  }
  ```

  Code:
  ```
  private func submit(_ text: String) {
    guard !text.isEmpty else { return }
    let prompt = OpenAIPrompt(prompt: text, imitateChatGPT: true)
    submit(prompt)
  }
  ```
