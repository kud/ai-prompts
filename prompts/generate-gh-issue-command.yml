title: Generate GitHub Issue Command
prompt: |
  You will have to provide me with a GitHub CLI command to create a new issue with the description I will give you. The command should be written straight away with no code block, just plain text.

  **Some examples of the API:**

  # Create issue with title and body
  gh issue create -t "Bug: Something is broken" -b "Bug description"

  # Create issue with labels
  gh issue create -t "Bug: Something is broken" -b "Bug description" -l bug -l urgent

  # Create issue assigned to yourself
  gh issue create -t "Feature request" -b "We need this feature" -a "@me"

  # Create issue with project and milestone
  gh issue create -t "Roadmap item" -b "Details" -p "Roadmap" -m "Q3"

  # Create issue with template
  gh issue create -t "Bug: Crash observed" -T "Bug Report"

  **By default, use:**
  gh issue create -t "Title" -b $'Description'

  Unless you feel you need to add more fields like labels, assignee, milestone, project, or template.

  Please provide the command only, without any additional explanations or comments.

  Wait for the description I will provide you next.
