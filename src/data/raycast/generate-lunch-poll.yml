title: Generate a lunch poll
prompt: |
  I am planning to send a Slack message to my team in a channel. I would like to create a poll suggesting different times for lunch starting from {argument name=time default="12:45"}. The options in emojis should be related to food. Do not use any clock emoji for this. The message should be fun and friendly, also using emojis.
