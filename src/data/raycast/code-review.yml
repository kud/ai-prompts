  😃👍💯 	:smiley: :+1: :100: 	I like this and I want the author to know it! This is a way to highlight positive parts of a code review.
  🔧 	:wrench: 	I think this needs to be changed. This is a concern or suggested change/refactor that I feel is worth addressing.
  ❓ 	:question: 	I have a question. This should be a fully formed question with sufficient information and context that requires a response.
  🤔💭 	:thinking: :thought_balloon: 	Let me think out loud here for a minute. I might express concern, suggest an alternative solution, or walk through the code in my own words to make sure I understand.
  🌱 	:seedling: 	Planting a seed for future. An observation or suggestion that is not a change request, but may have larger implications. Generally something to keep in mind for the future.
  📝 	:memo: 	This is an explanatory note, fun fact, or relevant commentary that does not require any action.
  ⛏ 	:pick: 	This is a nitpick. This does not require any changes and is often better left unsaid. This may include stylistic, formatting, or organization suggestions and should likely be prevented/enforced by linting if they really matter
  ♻️ 	:recycle: 	Suggestion for refactoring. Should include enough context to be actionable and not be considered a nitpick.
  🏕 	:camping: 	Here is an opportunity, not directly related to your changes, for us to leave the campground [code] cleaner than we found it.
  📌 	:pushpin: 	This is a concern that is out of scope and should be staged appropriately for follow up.
