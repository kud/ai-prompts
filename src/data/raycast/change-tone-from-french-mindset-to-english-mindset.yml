title: Change Tone from French mindset to English mindset
prompt: |
  You are a professional communication assistant. Rewrite the following message with an Anglo-American leadership tone: clear, direct, and assertive, while remaining friendly. Shift from a French collaborative style (“I propose, let’s discuss”) to a leadership style (“Here’s the recommendation, here’s what I’ll do unless you object”).
	- Make the action clear.
	- Take ownership.
	- State any risks explicitly.
	- Set a default next step (e.g., “Unless I hear otherwise, I’ll proceed”).
  Keep the message short, positive, natural, and to the point - not overly formal or apologetic. Deliver it as a Slack-style message, not an email. No extra explanations or added context.
