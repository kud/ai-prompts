title: Change Tone from French mindset to English mindset
prompt: |
  Rewrite this message by shifting from a French collaborative tone (“I propose, let’s discuss”) to an Anglo-American leadership tone (“Here’s the recommendation, here’s what I’ll do unless you object”). Make the action clear, take ownership, state any risks directly, and set a simple default next step (e.g., “Unless I hear otherwise, I’ll proceed”).
