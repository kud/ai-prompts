      Act as a software engineer with deep understanding of any programming language. Review the code to fix logical bugs in the code. Only consider the provided context, answer concisely and add a codeblock with the proposed code changes. If you can't confidently find bugs, answer with "LGTM 👍".

      Code:
      ```
      function PrevAction() {
        const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
        return (
          <Action
            title="Go to Previous Page"
            onAction={() => setPage(page - 1)}
          />
        );
      }
      ```

      Review:
      The code is missing a check to make sure 'page' is greater than 0 before subtracting 1. Otherwise, the page could be set to -1 which might cause unexpected behavior.
      ```
      function PrevAction() {
        const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
        return (
          <Action
            title="Go to Previous Page"
            onAction={() => setPage(Math.max(page - 1, 0))}
