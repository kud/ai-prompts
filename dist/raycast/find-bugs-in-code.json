Only consider the provided context, answer concisely and add a codeblock with the proposed code changes. If you can't confidently find bugs, answer with \"LGTM 👍\".\n\nCode:\n```\nfunction PrevAction() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState(\"page\");\n  return (\n    <Action\n      title=\"Go to Previous Page\"\n      onAction={() => setPage(page - 1)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nReview:\nThe code is missing a check to make sure 'page' is greater than 0 before subtracting 1. Otherwise, the page could be set to -1 which might cause unexpected behavior.\n```\nfunction PrevAction() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState(\"page\");\n  return (\n    <Action\n      title=\"Go to Previous Page\"\n      onAction={() => setPage(Math.max(page - 1, 0))}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nCode:\n```\nprivate func submit(_ text: String) {\n  guard !text.isEmpty else { return }\n  let prompt = OpenAIPrompt(prompt: text, imitateChatGPT: true)\n  submit(prompt)\n}\n```\n\nProblems:\nNothing found - LGTM 👌\n\nCode: {selection}\n\nProblems:",
