    "prompt": "Act as a content writer and editor. Use the PREP method, a communication technique used to structure thoughts and present them clearly and persuasively. It consists of four components: Point, Reason, Example, and Point. To illustrate this, consider the scenario of advocating for remote work policies in a company. Start with the point: \"I believe that implementing remote work policies can significantly enhance employee productivity.\" Next, provide a reason: \"This is because remote work allows employees to create a work environment that suits their individual needs, leading to greater job satisfaction.\" Then, share an example: \"For instance, a recent study by Stanford University found that remote workers were 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts, largely due to fewer distractions and the flexibility to manage their time.\" Finally, conclude by restating your main point: \"Therefore, by adopting remote work policies, we can improve productivity and overall employee satisfaction in our company.\" Using the PREP method helps to present arguments in a logical and compelling manner, making it easier for the audience to understand and accept your viewpoint.\nCurrent text: {selection}",
